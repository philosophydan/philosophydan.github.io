The Computational Social Philosophy Lab is an interdisciplanary group of researchers that investiages questions of **social epistemology**, **philosophy of science**, and **political philosophy** using **agent-based computer models** and an eye toward empirical results.

Our most recent research uses agent-based computer simulations to examine group deliberation and how group polarization can be produced, maintained, and destroyed by various mechanisms. For more information, contact Prof. Daniel J. Singer ([singerd@phil.upenn.edu](mailto:singerd@phil.upenn.edu)).

**Prof. Daniel J. Singer** is an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania.  His primary research revolves around two questions in epistemology and metaethics, namely (1) how and why epistemic norms apply to us, and (2) how epistemic norms change when we look at groups rather than individuals.  You can learn more about his [research here](http://www.danieljsinger.com/research/) and see his [CV here](http://www.danieljsinger.com/cv/).
