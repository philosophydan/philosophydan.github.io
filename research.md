I research many topics in **Epistemology**, **Metaethics**, and **Social Epistemology** (including where they intersect with **Political Philosophy** and **Philosophy of Science**). Here are some short descriptions of my major research projects.  For more information about my research, see my [CV](http://www.danieljsinger.com/cv/) or [contact me](http://www.danieljsinger.com/#contact).

### Truth-Centered Epistemology and the Source of Epistemic Norms
It's popular to think that epistemic norms can be understood in terms of an ultimate goal of having true beliefs and avoid false ones.  This kind of epistemic consequentialism has been subject to many objections in the literature.  I defend a version of true-belief-maximizing epistemic act-consequentialism that I term "Sophisticated Epistemic Consequentialism." The view captures the intuitive motivation behind the truth-centered views, clarifies the place of objective and subjective epistemic oughts in theorizing, and takes seriously the complex structure of epistemic values and the intricacies of human motivation. I also defend the ultimate goal epistemic goal as being constitutive of our agency, which (metaphysically) explains why we're subject to epistemic norms.

### Social Epistemology, Political Philosophy, and Philosophy of Science
What does a truth-centered epistemology mean for real epistemic agents, groups, and institutions?  That is the kind of question that's investigated by the [Computational Social Philosophy Lab](http://www.danieljsinger.com/CSPL/), an interdisciplinary group of researchers that investigates questions of social epistemology, philosophy of science, and political philosophy using agent-based computer models and an eye toward empirical results.  Our most recent research uses agent-based computer simulations to examine group deliberation and how group polarization can be produced, maintained, and destroyed by various mechanisms.  Previous research has included using agent-based computer simulations to examine arguments for the value of diversity, epistemic democracy, the nature of information and information transfer, and how communication networks affect epistemic communities.
