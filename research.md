I research on many topics in **Epistemology**, **Metaethics**, and **Social Epistemology** (including where it intersects with **Political Philosophy** and **Philosophy of Science**). Here are some short descriptions of my major research projects.  For more information about my research, see my [CV](http://www.danieljsinger.com/cv/) or [contact me](http://www.danieljsinger.com/#contact).

### Truth-Centered Epistemology
There is a popular idea that epistemic norms all stem from the ultimate goal of having true beliefs and avoid false ones.  This kind of _epistemic consequentialism_ has been subject to many objections in the literature.  I defend a version of truth-maximizing epistemic consequentialism that I term "Sophisticated Epistemic Consequentialism." The view captures the intuitive motivation behind the truth-centered views, clarifies the place of objective and subjective epistemic oughts in theorizing, and takes seriously the complex structure of epistemic values and the intricacies of human motivation.  This view is inspired by sophisticated consequentialist views in ethics, like the one given by Peter Railton.  In "Sophisticated Epistemic Consequentialism" (in progress), I provide a general framework for thinking about  sophisticated consequentialist views (in both ethics and epistemology).  That paper clarifies what these views can account for and show why epistemic consequentialists ought to be sophisticated too.  

Future work in this area will flesh out how the sophisticated consequentialist can make sense of norms of justification and knowledge as well as showing how sophisticated epistemic consequentialism generates norms for groups and communities via mutual obligations to maximize true beliefs.
