I am an Associate Professor of Philosophy at the [University of Pennsylvania](http://philosophy.sas.upenn.edu/), and I direct the [Computational Social Philosophy Lab](/CSPL/).  During the Spring quarter of 2018, I was a [Fellow of the Dartmouth Institute for Cross Disciplinary Engagement](http://ice.dartmouth.edu/fellows-program/daniel-singer).

[My research](http://www.danieljsinger.com/research/) is about what we should believe, both as individuals and as groups. The first part of my research is about epistemic consequentialism, a view that aims to be a fully general theory of what we ought to believe. In light of a series of objections to the view, many others have argued that truth-focused epistemic consequentialism is obviously a non-starter. I defend truth-focused epistemic consequentialism from those objections thereby vindicating the idea that what we ought to believe is determined by what gives rise to true beliefs (or accurate credences). The second part of my research uses agent-based computer models to better understand how groups of people reason together. This work has resulted in a number of insights about topics like diversity and polarization in groups, the nature of expertise, how information can move in groups, how democracies can improve or hinder information flow, and how representative and direct democracies compare. We're currently thinking a lot about the dynamics of juries too. For more information about that work, see the page for the [Computational Social Philosophy Lab](/CSPL/).

Conferences I organize:  
[Penn Reasons and Foundations in Epistemology Conference (PeRFECt)](http://www.danieljsinger.com/PeRFECt5/)  
[Penn-Rutgers-Princeton Social Epistemology Workshop (PRPSEW)](http://www.danieljsinger.com/PRPSEW/)

Before coming to Penn, I did a Ph.D. in Philosophy at the [University of Michigan](http://www.lsa.umich.edu/philosophy/). I started at Penn as an Assistant Professor in January of 2013, and I received tenure and a promotion to Associate Professor in July 2019.
