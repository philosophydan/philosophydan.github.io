I am an Associate Professor and Undergraduate Chair of [Philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania](http://philosophy.sas.upenn.edu/), and I do research primarily in **epistemology (including traditional, formal, and social epistemology)** and **metaethics**. 

I have a secondary appointment as an Associate Professor of [Legal Studies and Business Ethics in the Wharton School of Business](https://lgst.wharton.upenn.edu/). During the Spring quarter of 2018, I was a [Fellow of the Dartmouth Institute for Cross Disciplinary Engagement](http://ice.dartmouth.edu/fellows-program/daniel-singer).

[My research](http://www.danieljsinger.com/research/) is primarily motivated by the question of what we should believe, both as individuals and as groups. I'm currently working on a book titled **Right Belief and True Belief** (under contract with Oxford University Press) that argues for a general truth-loving epistemic consequentialist theory of what we should believe. I also direct the [Computational Social Philosophy Lab](/CSPL/), an interdisciplinary and international research group that uses agent-based computer models to better understand how groups of people can and should reason together. This work focuses on topics like diversity and polarization in groups, the nature of expertise, how the structure of groups (like scientific lab groups) affects what information the group receives, how democracies can improve or hinder information flow, and how groups like juries can be better constructed to achieve their aims. 

Conferences I organize:  
[Penn Reasons and Foundations in Epistemology Conference (PeRFECt)](http://www.danieljsinger.com/PeRFECt5/)  
[Penn-Rutgers-Princeton Social Epistemology Workshop (PRPSEW)](http://www.danieljsinger.com/PRPSEW/)

Before coming to Penn, I did a Ph.D. in Philosophy at the [University of Michigan](http://www.lsa.umich.edu/philosophy/). I started at Penn as an Assistant Professor in January of 2013, and I received tenure and a promotion to Associate Professor in July 2019.
